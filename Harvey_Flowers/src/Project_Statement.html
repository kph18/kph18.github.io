            <span style="float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 600%; line-height: 80%;">B</span>iblical scenes have been the
            subject of many paintings and other pieces throughout history; however, in
            recent times these scenes have become less and less common. Biblical scenes were powerful subject matters
            because of the ubiquity of the Bible and the inherent emotion of the scenes. Although the popularity of
            Christianity has ebbed and flowed throughout history, the scenes never lose the emotional tension that makes
            many of these paintings so special. Further, symbolism is ubiquitous in both the Bible and in visual art. The
            Bible contains a broad swath of
            symbols, from rainbows to stairs to doves. Flowers are referenced throughout the Bible, often used as
            metaphors for the human condition. For example, the verses from Luke 12:27-28:
            “27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in
            all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the
            field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?”
            describe the beauty of flowers and draw an analogy between the beauty of the flower and the amount of love
            God has for an individual. The innate beauty and intricacy of flowers and of nature in general has been a
            topic of interest for people since the beginning of time. Through well-known works of symbolism, including
            the Bible, individual flowers have gained general symbolic meaning in modern culture. This project will
            explore the power of symbolism through flowers and the depiction of Bible scenes.
